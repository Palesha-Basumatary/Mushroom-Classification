# Problem Statement 
This dataset is about classifying of a mushroom. This data science problem's domain is research field. This dataset contains 23 species of mushrooms and each of them are identified as poisonous or edible. 


## Dataset

The dataset used is the [mushroom_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) from Kaggle. 

Since the target of this project is to find if the mushroom is poisonous or not, it is a classification task.

The 2 class labels are:
<br>
**1. Poisonous:** Given mushroom is poisonous.
<br>
**2. Edible:** Given mushroom is edible.


## Model(s) Used
The models used for this task are Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision tree.

**-Logistic Regression** is a supervised machine learning model. It is used to predict a categorial target value using the predictors on the basis of probability. This model is fitted into the logistic function.

**-Naive Bayes** is a supervised machine learning model. This model is based on Bayes theorem and assumes that the features are unrelated to each others. It calculates the probability and choses the class with the highest probability.

**-Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning model. The Decision tree works by spliting the data into tree-like structure.
